def selfeat_variance(image_features, labels=None, thresh=0.99):
    '''
    Select features using a variance threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_features: numpy array, mandatory
            Array containing the feature values to apply the variance threshold
            selection on. The rows correspond to the patients, the column to the
            features.

    labels: numpy array, optional
            Array containing the labels of the corresponding features. Array
            should therefore have the same shape as the image_features array.

    thresh: float, default 0.99
            Threshold to be used as lower boundary for feature variance among
            patients.

    Returns
    ----------
    image_features: numpy array
            Transformed features array.

    labels: list or None
            When labels are given, returns the transformed labels. That object
            contains a list of all label names kept.

    sel: VarianceThreshold object
            The fitted variance threshold object.

    '''
    #Threshold dependent of mean of feature
    sel = varselection(threshold=thresh*(1 - thresh))

    #Threshold independent of mean
    #sel = VarianceThreshold(threshold=thresh*(1 - thresh))

    sel = sel.fit(image_features)
    print(sel)
    image_features = sel.transform(image_features)
    if labels is not None:
        labels = sel.transform(labels).tolist()[0]

    return image_features, labels, sel
